Hey there !

I'm currently pursuing a cybersecurity master's degree at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©. I'm also an apprentice for Sopra Steria. I like to spend my time learning new stuff and working on projects that make people's life easier.

If you came across this page, I suppose you most probably know me for an OSINT related project or an osu! related project.

I don't play as much as before ([osu! profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10671830)), but I will maintain my osu! projects for some time :)

To get in touch with me, please use one of the following medias, and let me know you're coming from my GitHub profile !
