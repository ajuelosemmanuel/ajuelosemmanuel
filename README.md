<h1 align="center">Emmanuel Ajuelos</h1>


Hey there !

I am a Masters graduate (cybersecurity) from Sorbonne UniversitÃ©. I also worked as an apprentice for Sopra Steria. I like to spend my time learning new stuff and working on projects that make people's life easier, and currently taking a break from work to focus on my "life" projects.

If you came across this page, I suppose you most probably know me for an OSINT related project or an osu! related project.

I don't play as much as before but I will maintain my osu! projects for some time :)

To get in touch with me, please use one of the following medias, and let me know you're coming from my GitHub profile !
